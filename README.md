Features

*  Browse all documents or by collection
*  Full-text search over all documents or by collection
*  Update document XML (syntax highlighting in the browser)
*  Update document properties and metadata (permissions, collections, etc.)
*  Create new documents at any database URI
*  Remove documents
*  Visualize document elements to spot patterns and anomalies
